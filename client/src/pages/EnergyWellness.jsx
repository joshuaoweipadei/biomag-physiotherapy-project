              The energy of absolute nothingness. Scalar energy has zero frequencies it is a stationary energy which cannot be evaluated by the current frequency instruments.
              The energy spin and expand in circle  form. It is a radiant energy a form of electromagnetic energy or invisible wave such as radio waves or x-rays.
              These waves can travwl through space.

            <p>Electromagnetic raiation is made up of tiny particles called photons tiny packets of energy.</p>
            <br/>

              The sun produce alot of radiant energy which is transmitted to earth as light. Plants convert the electromagnetic energy in sunlight
              into chemical energy for their food through aprocess called photosynthesis.

              Scalar energy is a form of energy that is predominately found in the rain forest in the mountian valley on in the sea-breeze.
              This energy carry information through time and distance. Scalar energy is found anywhere inthe world. It has magnitude but has no direction. 
              It is a discovery of completely a new kind of electromagnetic waves called scalar waves which exist in empty space such as which is present 
              in between the atoms in our body and empty space present above the earth and between the sun and the stars.

              Scalar waves  are longitudinal. Scalar waves are creaed by a pair of identical waves usually called it waves and antiwaves that are in phase spatially
              but out of phase temporally they are different ffrom normal hertizian waves scalar energy is created when two common electromagnetic waves comes together
              from two different converging vectors or angles, where the energy vectors equal frequencies cancels each other leaving a standing or stationary energy.
              This subtle energy form has healing properties. This energy was discovered by James Maxwell a Scotsman born in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
              Nikola Tesla demonstrated the existence of this energy. According to Tom Paladino a scalar energy researcher. Scalar energy operates at the quantum level
              and is capable of disassembling all types of pathogens remotely, for instance bacteria virus, fungi, amoeba, parasite and protozoa infestation thus eliminating
              causaive agents of diseases scalar energy can be embedded into nutritional product or solid object to promote wellness.
